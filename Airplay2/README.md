# Airplay 2

The Home Assistant addon allows you to use your device,
running Home Assistant, to be used as an Airplay 2 player.
This is made possible by the "[Shairport-Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync)" audio player
made by mikebrady.

This Addon is just Debian Container with the audio player pre-installed,
this leads to the image being quite large in comparison to other addons (â‰ˆ 750 MB).
This could probably be reduced using an Alpine image.
