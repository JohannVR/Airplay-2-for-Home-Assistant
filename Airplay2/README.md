# Airplay 2

This Home Assistant addon allows you to use the device,
running Home Assistant as an Airplay 2 receiver.
This is made possible by the "[Shairport-Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync)" audio player
made by mikebrady.

This Addon is just Debian Container with the Airplay receiver pre-installed,
this leads to the image being quite large in comparison to other addons (â‰ˆ 750 MB).
This could probably be reduced using an Alpine image.
